# Bootcamp Project 1 : Mood Boost

## Project Description: 
This application is to help the user to improve their mood. There are 4 pages on this application. The first page is to select the user mood. Once the user selected their mood, it will store that into the last page. Then it will take the user to the next page, the themes page. On the themes page, there are 6 categories to choose. Once the user chooses their favorite catergory, it will store that information and saved in the last page. Once the user pick their favourite category, it will take them to the next page, which is the music page. Again, the user has 6 favourite music genres to select from. Once they had picked their favourite genre, it will store this information and append to the final page. On the final page, there will be giphys, jokes, and music being played from the user's request. 

## User Story: 
i am a user feeling a particular sort of way and want some entertainment that matches my mood. ie. a "meme"
our application will take in a users emotional state in the form of a set of buttons, hit two apis based on user input, one for giphy for out image, secondly the first input will also determine a song that will play on the final page. secondly the user will be presented a second set of buttons each of which will be a category of humor, the user will select one and again on the third page be provided with a joke or anecdote based on their choice. so on the final page the user will be presented a "meme" in the form of a gif with a joke attached to it, and an song playing that is appropriate to the users inputs.
